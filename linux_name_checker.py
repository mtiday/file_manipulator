"""File name checker for Windows
This program crawls through a directory and lets you know if there are
names that will be considered duplicates in Windows. i.e. two folders
named example and Example in Linux would be the same folder in Windows.
Therefore if you copied this directory from Linux to Windows not
everything would copy.
